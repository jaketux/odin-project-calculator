I have created a Calculator for The Odin Project This project allowed me to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a functioning calculator. The calculator chains operations without having to hit 🟰 each time.

Note:

% takes the number and divides it by 100.

+/- converts the outcome from positive to negative or vice versa.
